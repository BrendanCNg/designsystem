## Tips

### Structure

- Use headings `<h1> - <h6>` to add structure to the page. The main title should be a `<h1>` and should communicate the main focus of the page. Subsequent headings should be used to give titles to subsections. 
- Breadcrumbs are useful on pages with multiple levels of nesting. They help make users aware of their current location with respect to the website and provide a quick point of reference in case they get lost. 
- For longer pages, it can be appropriate to use the inpage navigation component at the top of the page, to give users an indication of the contents of the page. 
- Avoid using `<div>` tags for everything. Use semantic HTML elements such as `<section>`, `<article>`, `<main>` etc. This helps screen reader users identify each type of content and allows for quick navigation via assistive technology landmark menus.

### Content

- Avoid using accordions to hold content that is primary to the page. It is not a replacement for well structured headings and plain text.
- These pages should be easily print friendly, allowing users to save the page as a PDF or print a physical copy. By default the design system components are styled with print styles in mind, though more guidance can be found on the [Mozilla documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media#Examples).
