## Tips

### Structure

- Use headings `<h1> - <h6>` to add structure to the page. The main title should be a `<h1>` and should communicate the main focus of the page. Subsequent headings should be used to give titles to sub sections. 
- Breadcrumbs are useful for sites that are more than two levels deep. 
- For longer pages, it can be appropriate to use the inpage navigation component at the top of the page, to give users an indication of the contents of the page. 
- Avoid using `<div>` tags for all content. Use semantic HTML elements such as `<section>`, `<article>`, `<main>` etc.

### Content

- Avoid using accordions to hold content that is primary to the page. It is not a replacement for well structured headings and plain text.
- For more guidance on content, please see the information on the [content guide](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/) website.
