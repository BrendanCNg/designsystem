## Tips

### Structure

- Variations of the `.au-body` selector such as `.au-body--alt or .au-body--dark` or a combination of them can be used to slice up the page into horizontal sections of different shades. These contrasting sections can make it easier to categorise different sections on the page.



### Content

- The first section following the header should contain the headline. Generally a concise summary of what the site purpose is.
- Position content/sections higher on the page based on their value and/or relevance.
- For more guidance on content, please see the information on the [content guide](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/) website.
