The home page template includes all the building blocks to start creating a home page.

The fully responsive page layout uses the `grid-12` component for alignment of content througout the sections. 

The different sections can be themed with the `au-body--dark` or `au-body--alt` css classes. Allowing you to customise the layout to meet your user needs.
