In mobile/small device layouts the main navigation uses an icon which represents the menu. This follows a common convention of mobile interface design.

**Hamburger?** The 3 bar icon used on mobile is often affectionately referred to in user interface design as a “Hamburger” or “Hamburger menu” due to its appearance.

**Note.** Not all users know that a hamburger means navigation or menu. **The icon is never shown on it’s own** and must have accompany text to avoid assumed understanding of the icon.
