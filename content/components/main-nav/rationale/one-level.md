layout: component/rationale.js
heading: One level

The main navigation currently only supports one level as a first-version solution. Mostly in order to keep the component relatively simple, reducing complexity for development and accessibility.

For discussion around requirements for deeper levels see the [main navigation community topic](https://community.digital.gov.au/t/main-nav).
