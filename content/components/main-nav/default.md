The main navigation component is intended to be used as the primary means of navigation around the website. The main navigation typically accommodates the top level of the information architecture should not be restricted to that use if other components address that level.

Main navigation is designed to to work closely with the [header](/components/header/) component and collapses down to a typical open/close menu button on smaller devices.

**Note:** Being a horizontal list main navigation doesnâ€™t accommodate a large amount of items and is not intended to. If more space is needed consider another navigation component such as the [side nav](/components/side-nav/).
