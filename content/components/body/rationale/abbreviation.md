Screen reader support for the `<abbr>` element is [limited](https://www.powermapper.com/tests/screen-readers/labelling/acronym-abbr-title/) and use of this element should be avoided. Abbreviations should be handled in accordance with [readability guidelines](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/terms-phrases/#acronyms) defined in the content guide. This means use contextual abbreviation for the first mention, and using the abbreviated term in future mentions.

As an example:

> Lorem ipsum Web Content Authoring Guideline (WCAG) ipsum dolor sit amet. Quisquam totam perspiciatis WCAG oluta et reiciendis expedita suscipit culpa id.

The W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) provide a [similar example](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G97.html). This way the reading-experience of a screen reader more closely user matches that of a non screen reader user.
