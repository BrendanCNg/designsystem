Screen reader support for the `<abbr>` element is [limited](https://www.powermapper.com/tests/screen-readers/labelling/acronym-abbr-title/). Abbreviations should be done in accordance with [readability guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G97.html). This means use contextual abbreviation for the first mention, and using the abbreviated term in future mentions.
As an example:

> Lorem ipsum Web Content Authoring Guideline (WCAG) ipsum dolor sit amet. Quisquam totam perspiciatis WCAG oluta et reiciendis expedita suscipit culpa id.

This way the reading-experience of a screen reader more closely user matches that of a non screen reader user.
