heading: Active state and active trail
---

The active state is intended to show which page the user is currently on and uses something other than colour in order to meet [WCAG2.0 Criterion 1.4.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-without-color.html)

The side navigation supports an active trail of pages in order to better demonstrate the hierarchy that the current page is in. Similar in function to breadcrumbs.
