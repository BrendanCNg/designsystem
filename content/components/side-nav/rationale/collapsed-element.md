heading: Styles for the collapsed element

It was found through usability testing in beta that the collapsed navigation was often accidentally missed by users when styled like an accordion (which is required to be more subtle).

The design of the collapsed element uses a combination of the layout and styles of a button in order to provide more visual prominence. With the icon/behaviour of the accordion for consistent and predictable behaviour across components.
