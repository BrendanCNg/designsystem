Each level in the side nav needs to be easily visually identifiable as a new level, beyond 3 levels visual solutions quickly become too complex or drastically reduce the available line-length for links.

After reviewing multiple government and private sector websites it was found that the upper extent of complex navigation solutions tended to be around 5 levels. To avoid overly complex user interfaces the navigation is often split into various groups. Typically 2 levels in the main-navigation, and 3 in side navigation, supported by listing/landing pages if more levels are required.
