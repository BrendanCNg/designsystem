layout: component/rationale.js
heading: No expand and collapse accordion

We chose not to implement an expand/collapse accordion style that collapses the open accordion when another accordion is clicked as this causes unpredictable behaviour. We wanted to make sure that users have full control over what content remains visible to minimise possible confusion when content suddenly ‘disappears’ from view.
